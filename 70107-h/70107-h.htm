<p>George Marion, the author of this pamphlet, was born and
raised in the Middle West. A member of the Newspaper Guild
(C.I.O.), he got his education in “free” journalism at first
hand. His experience covers work in every department of news
manufacturing, the modern process by which “marketable
words and images” are produced. He is a veteran war correspondent
and roving reporter, and his news background includes
a period with the defunct semi-official French news
agency, Havas; free-lancing in Europe, North Africa, and
India; and front-line reporting of the historic conflict in
Spain of the 1935–37 years, Hitler’s “dress rehearsal” for World
War II. When this pamphlet went to press, he was on the
staff of the New York <i>Mirror</i>.</p>

<span class="subhead">IT’S FREE—FOR MILLIONAIRES!</span></h2>

<p>Brooks Atkinson filed a peevish dispatch to the <i>New York
Times</i> from his Moscow post not long ago. Atkinson, ex-dramatic
critic, is a highly-civilized, able and honest correspondent
whose reports from China and the Soviet Union have
shown a certain respect for people as people. His cablegrams
are often touched with humor. All the more striking was the
humorless dispatch in which he complained:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Soviet Union goes on coldly repeating Marxian
myths about America—that we have no freedom of the press,
that our democracy is formal but not real. Only the other
day the Moscow <i>Bolshevik</i> was saying:</p>

<p>In the conditions of bourgeois democracy the workers
do not have the minimum material requirements for actual
use of the rights that are proclaimed. They do not have at
their disposal printing presses and paper. Newspapers, clubs,
theatres—all are the property of private individuals or
groups.</p>
</div>

<p>Atkinson sneered: “If these old myths are not deliberately
false then they are products of the lack of a basic understanding.”</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Constitution of the United States
formally guarantees to anyone the right to publish a newspaper
in our country. The law is just and equal, forbidding unemployed
worker and millionaire alike to sleep on park benches,
guaranteeing either the freedom to buy or establish the huge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
enterprise called a newspaper. But where does Mr. Atkinson
think a working man can obtain the <em>means</em> to publish and
widely circulate a daily newspaper?</p>

<p>The entire labor movement has been unable to maintain
a single daily newspaper comparable in physical facilities and
size of circulation to the average privately-owned newspaper.
Publication of a daily requires a starting sum beyond the
present reach of working people. Oswald Garrison Villard,
proud of his family’s 125 years in the publishing field, says
that “no one would dream of starting a metropolitan newspaper
with less than ten or even fifteen millions in the bank.”
The newest modern presses alone run into the millions. The
physical plant of the <i>New York Daily News</i>, occupied in 1930,
was then worth $10,000,000. A few bad years while a paper
is getting on its feet may cost millions more.</p>

<h3>Ask Marshall Field</h3>

<p>Enough capital to start a paper is only the beginning.
Marshall Field, who inherited $164,000,000, found that all his
millions could buy him only a curiously limited area of press
freedom. His <i>Chicago Sun</i>, set up to combat the ultra-reactionary
<i>Chicago Tribune</i>, had to fight for its very life—all the way
to the U.S. Supreme Court. Field’s conclusion as the result of
his own experience is that it is easier to buy an established
daily newspaper than to launch a new one.</p>

<p>Do you want to buy a newspaper? There is probably not a
daily in America that can be bought for less than $2,000,000!
The <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> was sold in 1930 for a reported
$18,000,000. The <i>New York Times</i> has no price. It boasted a
gross annual business of $20,000,000 as much as twenty-five
years ago. Since then, the bulk of its constantly mounting
profits has been ploughed back into the business year after
year until the paper, considered purely as a business, represents
a fabulous investment. Naturally, money will not buy it.</p>

<p>Very well, you can’t buy a paper. Try to establish a new
one. Field found out what that meant. The local news-gathering
service, in Chicago, was barred to him. He had
to set up his own reportorial staff on a scale to overcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
this handicap. But for national and worldwide news, no
such solution was possible. Not even <em>his</em> fortune could finance
an adequate global news service.</p>

<p>There are only three such American news agencies, Associated
Press, United Press and International News Service.
Associated Press is a professedly “cooperative” membership
association embracing some 1,300 of America’s 1,744 English-language
dailies. United Press, controlled by Roy Howard, is
based on his newspaper chain. I.N.S. rests on the Hearst chain.
Major newspapers try to have as many of these services as
they can get. The Howard-owned papers, for instance, are
by no means content with their own U.P. service, but seek
also the A.P. “report.” The Hearst papers never operate with
I.N.S. alone; almost all have A.P. franchises and several boast
that they alone, in their respective areas, have all three services.
For a variety of reasons, however, A.P. is the decisive agency.
It is rather hopeless to try to compete with a major paper on
the basis of U.P. or I.N.S. service.</p>

<p>Field could not get A.P. The by-laws of the “cooperative”
permitted the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> to blackball his application
for membership. He could not get I.N.S. because it is
available only to the Hearst paper in Chicago, the <i>Herald-American</i>.
He had no choice but to publish on the basis of
United Press service only. That cost him $110,000 in 1942
against an estimated $50,000 he would have paid for the
superior A.P. report.</p>

<h3>Regimentation</h3>

<p>News agency coverage was only the beginning of the problem.
Look at your daily newspaper, wherever you live. It is
the same paper as the one I read. There is, in effect, only one
American newspaper, or let us say three or four papers which
are parts of one pattern. Your paper and mine print exactly
the same news, the same pictures, the same columnists, the
same features ranging from comics through recipes, and often
the same canned editorials supplied by the Newspaper Enterprise
Association. Moreover, these canned features, together
with new mechanical inventions, make for standardized typography<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
and appearance. Even grammatical style, width of
column, size of type, must be uniform. The standardization
reaches its ridiculous peak in the Hearst papers where “The
Chief,” octogenarian William Randolph Hearst, dictates by
teletype the manner and form in which his “publishers” must
display many important items.</p>

<p>There is no escaping this regimentation. If you want readers,
you must meet the competition. Field had to have features,
pictures and so on. He struggled to create his own comics and
after three years felt he had achieved some readable ones,
though by no means as successful as those controlled by the
rival press. But news pictures can’t be invented. Without
photographs, successful newspaper publication is impossible.
Pictures, however, are as tightly controlled as news services.
Even the Communist <i>Daily Worker</i>, the outstanding labor
daily newspaper in the country, has to buy from the syndicates
as they are. Field couldn’t buy any!</p>

<p>Associated Press owns A.P. Wirephotos and the Wideworld
newsphoto service. The <i>Tribune</i> barred sale of these pictures
to Field. Acme, the Howard-dominated picture service, was
likewise denied him through an “exclusive contract” between
Acme and the <i>Tribune</i>. Hearst’s International News Photos
were not available in Chicago because they went to the <i>Herald-American</i>.</p>

<p>In 1942 Field spent $63,000 on pictures and $425,000 to
maintain news bureaus and other items, an outlay due chiefly
to the monopoly conditions he faced—which anyone who wants
to publish must face. A smaller capitalist would have been
licked at that point, but Field had sufficient power to launch
anti-trust proceedings against Associated Press as a means of
breaking out of the encirclement.</p>

<p>The United States Supreme Court sustained Field. The
<i>Tribune</i>-A.P. were forced to let him purchase the A.P.
news report. But the court decision has not made a general
break in the monopoly structure. If one of the major trade
union bodies, for instance, wants to publish a daily newspaper
in New York, Chicago, Detroit or Los Angeles, there is nothing
to prevent A.P. and all the other services from declining to
sell their indispensable goods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p>There is no use dreaming about building—on however broad
a liberal-labor cooperative plane—an independent apparatus to
escape the news, picture and feature service squeeze. It would
cost not millions but billions. Though the services have acquired
an independent existence and structure, they are basically
the American press itself. The newspapers are not only
their market but their major source of supply. They provide
most of the local news and pictures used by the agencies.</p>

<h3>This Is Monopoly</h3>

<p>Some idea of the concentration and integration of the
American newspaper industry may be obtained by a glance at
Associated Press, the typical expression of the industry. A.P.
has bureaus in 250 world cities, 94 within the U.S. Seven of
these have fifty or more full-time staff members and the whole
A.P. domestic payroll covers 7,200 employees, 1,940 on a full-time
basis. A.P. also has 2,500 correspondents abroad using a
leased transatlantic cable. It has 290,000 miles of leased wires
linking 727 American cities. Its daily general news report alone
exceeds 1,000,000 words, single metropolitan papers taking
from 250,000 to 300,000 words a day. There are endless additional
reports. A.P.’s 1942 expenditures totalled $12,986,000.
(United Press spent $8,628,000; I.N.S., $9,434,000.) A.P.’s
material reserves exceed $100,000,000.</p>

<p>But all this describes only the independent structure of
Associated Press. The bulk of the personnel of the American
press is also a part of the A.P. apparatus. Member papers—which
means most of the country’s newspapers and <em>all the
important ones</em>—must make all their news available to A.P.
and are expected to withhold it from anyone outside of A.P.
Even employees of the papers are similarly bound. Any news
they “spontaneously” acquire belongs to A.P. Thus, instead
of a mere 5,000 to 10,000 employees, A.P. really has some
100,000 persons working for it every hour of the day and
night. It coordinates the whole news-gathering apparatus of
the American press. It does this on an exclusive basis. It is
not only a monopoly but the expression of the monopolistic
organization of the American press.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<h3>Pikers Barred</h3>

<p>The monopoly structure of the industry plus the size and
complexity of newspaper operation from a business point of
view, have made it impossible for any but multimillionaires
to enter the field. As a logical result, there has been a steady
shrinkage of the field—a drop in the number of dailies from
2,600 in 1909 to 1,744 at the beginning of 1945.</p>

<p>This shrinkage has been accompanied by a virtual disappearance
of competition in most cities. In 1899, 353 cities were
dominated by a single newspaper. In 1920 there were 720
such cities. In 1945 there were 1,103. In many of the remaining
cities, the “competing” papers were under a single ownership
so that the actual number of cities without competition
in 1945 was 1,277. Conversely, there were 549 cities with
local competition in 1920 but only 117 in 1945. In percentages
it is still worse. Of all cities having newspapers, only 8.4 per
cent had competition in 1945.</p>

<p>Even these figures are flattering to the myth of free and
competitive enterprise. Veiled joint ownership and “gentlemen’s
agreements” plus the spread of the chains and the
general standardization process still further reduce the area
of competition and restrict the diversity of views. Only the
half-dozen largest cities in the United States have dailies with
competing views in even the narrowest sense. The 25 largest
cities average but three ownerships. <i>Editor and Publisher</i>,
organ of the owners, admits the phenomenon and apologizes
for it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The condition has arisen not by the will of any individual
or group, but from a gradual growth of custom, both
in newspaper operation and in the purchase of advertising
space.</p>
</div>

<p>This refers to the preference of advertisers for fewer papers
with larger circulations. The net effect is that the local monopolies
are barricaded against competition and the price
of admission is several million dollars.</p>

<span class="subhead">FOR WHOM THE PRESS TOILS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>If ownership of the press is closed to all but an estimated
1,300 multimillionaire owners, whose opinions appear in it?
The obvious answer is: the opinions of the owners. They make
no bones about it. Canons of ethics sometimes pay lip service
to “public interest,” but in making legal commitments the
publishers insist on written guarantees that their views and
nobody else’s shall go into “their” newspapers. The American
Newspaper Guild, for instance, is forced to reacknowledge,
from time to time, its formal acceptance of the publishers’
opinion monopoly. Newspaper workers claim no right to speak
through the pages of their employers’ papers. From copyboy
to top editor, newspapermen are hired hands, engaged for the
sole purpose of putting their employer’s opinions in print.</p>

<p>Newspapers being a Big Business, the views of newspaper
owners are the views of Big Business. Thousands of specific
instances of unmitigated partisanship have been assembled
and documented by George Seldes in his several books and
in his weekly newsletter, <em>In Fact</em>. Former Secretary of the
Interior Harold Ickes and others have also written books
and articles primarily devoted to this theme. One has only to
observe the handling of the recent wage crisis by the press.
It stacked the cards against labor, playing up the strikes and
playing down capital’s bold blackmail drive for higher prices
and weaker unions.</p>

<p>The press is, in fact, an important part of the State apparatus.
It plays a key role in maintaining the rule of the Sixty
Families over the 140,000,000 people of the United States.
It is a tool in the hands of the few finance capitalists who
remain all-powerful so long as they are able to keep the
masses divided and confused.</p>

<p>It is true that the press lords are forever wailing about an
alleged government menace to press freedom. The conflict of
press and government does not contradict, however, the charge
that the press is an instrument of the State. The common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
notion that State and government are two names for one thing,
makes a few words on theory advisable at this point. A hundred
or a hundred and fifty years ago, there would have been
less likelihood of similar confusion. In the great political
strife that attended and immediately followed the adoption
of the United States Constitution, political theory was treated
with more respect than it is today. Federalists and Jeffersonians
agreed that the State was an instrument of class rule. Jeffersonian
John Taylor saw revolution and “order” as “two modes
of invading private property; the first, by which the poor
plunder the rich ... sudden and violent; the second, by
which the rich plunder the poor, slow and legal.” Summarizing
Taylor’s views, historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. says:
“The succession of privileged orders through history—the
priesthood, the nobility, now the banking system—showed how
every age had known its own form of institutionalized robbery
by a minority operating through the State.” Lenin later put
it scientifically: “The State is an organ of class domination,
an organ of oppression of one class by another; its aim is the
creation of ‘order’ which legalizes and perpetuates this oppression.”</p>

<h3>The American State</h3>

<p>Classes do not march in a straight line to their goals. Sometimes
the executive arm of government is completely responsive
to the views of the most reactionary section of capitalism,
as when Hoover, Harding, Coolidge were President. Sometimes
the President is not fully “manageable,” as in the case of
President Roosevelt. But he then finds himself pretty well
invested by “trustworthy” men; he must accept a John Garner
for Vice-President; he must put men like Jesse Jones in his
Cabinet. In the same way, Congress may be an easy tool of
reactionary interests one term, curbed by public pressure the
next. Note the speed with which the last few Congresses have
enacted drastic anti-labor legislation and tax bills pouring
billions into the coffers of Big Business. If an active public
conscience restricts the freedom of executive departments and
legislative departments otherwise favorable to Big Business,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
there are always the courts. When the democrats, Jefferson,
Madison, Monroe, held the presidency, Martin Van Buren
noted that the party of rich-man’s-rule fled to “the judicial department
of the government, as to an ark of future safety which
the Constitution placed beyond the reach of public opinion.”
So today the courts readily grant anti-picketing injunctions
to employers despite laws expressly designed to halt such use
of the injunction. Below the Federal level, government is
even more easily dominated by big capital. The local police are
always at hand for strike duty. Governors and mayors dance
to Big Business tunes.</p>

<p>Beyond all these departments of government are other tools
at the service of the ruling class to help it maintain political
dominance, regiment public opinion, terrorize and repress
dissenters, employ and reward servants and agents of all kinds,
to the end of constantly increasing its profits, intensifying its
exploitation of the population and extending its enormous
powers. Schools, churches, theaters are manipulated by boards
directly selected by leading capitalists. The Morgans and
Rockefellers personally oversee, as trustees, the largest universities,
public libraries and museums. Radio, moving pictures,
and the press—frankly described by their private owners
as “opinion-forming industries”—are even more elaborately
controlled devices for class rule.</p>

<p>Of all these, the press is the most powerful single force in
our time. The United States maintains a public-opinion-forming
apparatus unparalleled in history and unequalled in any
other land for the sheer weight of “information” hurled at a
defenseless public. There is no chance for the public to make
up its own mind.</p>

<h3>Private Power</h3>

<p>The newspaper owners have virtually unlimited control of
this apparatus despite their elaborate pretense of suffering
government constraint. The outcry against the government is
a complete fraud. The owners are simply demanding a monopoly
power over public opinion. They go so far as to impose a
virtual censorship on an Administration with which they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
not in complete sympathy. They got Congress to pass an act
frankly designed to suppress Marshall Field’s pro-Roosevelt
newspapers. If you so much as criticize the opinion-monopoly,
you are accused of attacking freedom of the press. The monopolists
have bulldozed the politicians until no less bold a
critic than Mr. Ickes has gone on record as opposing publication
of even a single government newspaper.</p>

<p><em>Yet the very idea of government as the chief enemy of press
freedom is a fraud on history.</em> Long before the rise of modern
industry, when printing was invented, the feudal ruling
classes were indeed opposed to the spread of information
among the dark masses. They objected not only to newspapers
but even to the printing and distribution of the Bible.
Not the content of the printed matter but the general increase
of knowledge and understanding was the point at issue.
The greater the ignorance of the people, the less danger to
their rule.</p>

<p>Modern industry, however, requires millions of literate
workers. The general level of education and information must
rise. The new ruling classes, the merchant princes, the industrialists,
the finance capitalists, are forced to accede to this
trend. Their attitude toward the press changes. Instead of
seeking to limit the volume of newspaper information, they
seek to control the content and use the papers as a tool. The
deliberate spread of misinformation and class propaganda replaces
the tactic of suppression. Neither government, nor the
ruling classes who dominate the government, try to restrict
this outpouring. That was a problem in the age of feudalism;
the true problem today is that the press is monopolized by a
wealthy and powerful clique. It has become one of the most
powerful instruments of the capitalist State, on a par with
the government itself!</p>

<p>“The use as well as the misuse of information has made the
power of suggestion the decisive force in world affairs,” says
Dean Ackerman of the Columbia School of Journalism, a
pillar of the news industry. “It can cause or prevent war. It
can strengthen or destroy a democracy. It can build or wreck
a nation.”</p>

<span class="subhead">WORDS FOR SALE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Class control of the press does not mean simple operation in
the interests of capitalist newspaper owners. The owners are
kept in line by the class as a whole so that they protect the
interests of Big Business, and express the views of capital in
general, rather than merely personal views.</p>

<p>The pressure of advertisers, the family connections of the
publisher and so on, do not fully explain the capitalist owner’s
loyalty to his class. There is a deeper reason. The class
function is so thoroughly built into the structure of the
American newspaper industry that even millionaire mavericks,
Marshall Fields, can stray but slightly from the class corral.
The publishers themselves are powerless to change the over-all
character of the press as the voice of finance capital.</p>

<p>The “built-in” class control of the press did not come about
through a convention or secret meeting of machiavellian
bankers, nor even through the constant pressure of the National
Association of Manufacturers. It came about in a way no
one could have planned. It was a historical process of a complicated
kind. The best thing we can do is to study the process
and the resulting structure of the press without oversimplifying.</p>

<h3>Subsidies</h3>

<p>Even before the War of Independence, the American press
lived on subsidies. Our holier-than-thou “free” publishers love
to point scornfully at the subsidies paid their “un-free” European
rivals. These they call “bribes” to spread national propaganda.
The American publisher can see the mote in his
brother’s eye but not the beam in his own. For political parties,
the government and private interests have at various times
subsidized our papers—and still do. There is no secret about
it. Any competent study of the business—<i>The Daily Newspaper
in America</i>, by A.&#160;M. Lee, for instance—has the detailed story.</p>

<p>The United States government subsidizes the press by means
of special mailing privileges. Postal rates for newspapers at
newspapers. What price subsidy? In 1908, 64 per cent of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
mail (by weight) was newspapers; it brought the Post Office
but 4 per cent of its revenues. The press, for all its cries of
rage at “government extravagance,” insists on continuance of
this patronage. The welcomed “handout” costs taxpayers from
$25,000,000 to $10,000,000 a year, it is estimated.</p>

<p>Second-class mailing privileges and the like are only a
minor factor in the subsidy system. Preferential wire rates for
news is the big thing. Billions of news-words transmitted
each year ordinarily get their low rates from private companies
owning the telephone, telegraph, wireless, radio, cable and
other facilities. But all communications are matters of public
franchise and the preferential rates were the result of State
intervention.</p>

<p>The recently published <i>Report From the Commission on
Freedom of the Press</i> further reveals how government directly
intervenes by creating communications. During World War II
the armed services tripled telecommunications mileage and
fabulously multiplied capacity. Against a pre-war private
cable-wireless capacity of 12,500,000 words a day, “the service
networks have done as much as 50,000,000 words per day.”
The new State-created communications include marvelous
technological advances such as multiple-address newscasting,
simultaneous broadcasting of several messages through the
same microphone, and facsimile newscasting.</p>

<p>Where the State creates and controls communications, subsidizing
them, is it not nonsense to speak of the press—the
communications-based news industry—as independent of the
State?</p>

<h3>What Is News?</h3>

<p>Still more deeply hidden is a curious twist in the character
of news itself. What is news? A well-worn “gag” accurately
describes the publishing industry’s concept. “If a man bites
a dog, that’s news.” There is nothing unexpected, nothing
unusual, nothing <em>sensational</em> about a dog biting a man; hence,
that isn’t news. In short, an accurate picture of what is happening
is not news. News is a name for unrelated, torn-from-context
events or incidents of a sensational character.</p>

<p>Man-bites-dog may be a gag but it is no joke. It contains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
the link between the obvious faults of our press and their
hidden disease. The techniques by which American newspapers
turn events into profit are all an expression of the man-bites-dog
idea. The compulsory use of the “lead” and headline
(with the consequent development of the “headline mentality”
decried by the late President Roosevelt), is merely the
final expression of the technical process. The whole process
consists in finding or creating sensations to exploit. The object
being to sell papers, not to maintain just values, “news”
is not that which informs but that which sells another newspaper
to a badgered reader. Not only complicated international
affairs but even “local” stories are distorted beyond
recognition of the facts by these techniques. The “crime waves”
cooked up out of quite average statistics from time to time are
a sample (whatever further reactionary ends they may serve).</p>

<p>The preoccupation with selling papers against fierce competition
leads to the American practice of an edition every
thirty seconds. This mania for speed, plus the man-bites-dog
news formula, works to corrupt and discourage the men who
handle news. At length, even the boasted accuracy of the press
about elementary facts becomes a myth and a fraud. “The
reliability of news accounts is far below what it was years ago
... the reporter is trained to look for the bizarre as all-important
...” writes Oswald Garrison Villard in <i>The Disappearing
Daily</i>. Anyone who has ever figured in a news story
knows that the printed “facts” have little to do with reality!</p>

<h3>True and Unbiased News</h3>

<p>News was not always limited to this formula of sensation.
The telegraph changed the whole basis of newspaper production
and sale. It compelled papers to carry a picture of the
whole country and ultimately the whole world whereas they
used to be little more than local bulletins. Costs greatly
increased, and to defray them publishers formed pools. Thus
the modern news agency was born and with the agency came a
standardized manner of treating news.</p>

<p>When the first agencies began operating, newspapers were
very violent in their opinions and intemperate in expressing
them. If a news agency wanted to serve all, it would have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
find a way of reporting what would offend none. At first,
transmission of a limited kind of news was undertaken: deaths,
fires, market prices, textual matter. To cover the whole range
of news, however, the agency had to learn how to report controversial
matters that all the papers wanted, in a way acceptable
to all. For instance, it must report a political contest in
a form printable by papers backing either major party. The
news agencies learned to do that just 100 years ago.</p>

<p>This reporting formula is what the American news industry
calls “true and unbiased news.” It is regarded as something
holy. A more than religious fervor marks the industry’s references
to it. Kent Cooper, executive director of A.P., admits that
it was not “the result of philosophic study or prayer,” but he
is proud that A.P. puts “into forceful and lasting effect the
moral concept that necessity had invented.” He further calls
it the “greatest moral concept ever developed in America and
given to the world.”</p>

<p>A second’s thought is enough to reveal that there is nothing
“moral” about the concept at all. The successful agency formula
does not require “truth.” It requires only the transmission
of views or “facts” acceptable and useful to <em>all capitalist
newspaper owners</em>. It does not eliminate bias. <em>It merely eliminates
differences between individual publishers and reduces
reporting to the common bias of owners as a group.</em> This formula
for standardized treatment of events and opinions is
completely devoid of moral content. It has melted all varieties
of information, all events and interrelations, down to one
kind of easily sold and exchanged piece of goods: the commodity,
news.</p>

<p>Though United Press is today as pompous as A.P. about the
supposed “objectivity” of American agency “news,” Roy
Howard was franker when he was fighting an uphill battle
for U.P.’s life. He then complained bitterly of A.P.’s monopolistic
practices in “collecting and selling a basic journalistic
commodity—news—in a highly competitive field.” He also
said: “I do not subscribe to the general idea that news and
opinion are two different and easily separated elements.” Consider
news about Negroes, for instance, as handled by the
agencies. Most of it emanates from Southern newspapers with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
avowed lily-white views; it is for distribution to all subscribers
but must not “offend” the large bloc of Southern
papers. So it is all bias and a continent wide.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, labor journalism had to solve the same
problem that led the capitalist agencies to their news formula.
The American Federation of Labor established Federated
Press in 1919 to serve the labor press, chiefly weekly and
monthly membership journals. The labor movement was and
is rent by factions; jurisdictional feuds are topped by the
present division of labor into the A.&#160;F. of L. and C.I.O. camps.
Yet Federated Press has always been able to supply news acceptable
to warring factions and rival unions. The agency
never pretended, however, that it was non-partisan in a
larger sense. F.P. Chief Carl Haessler said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The management of the Federated Press has never subscribed
to the hypocritical assertion of the capitalist newspapers
that news can be without bias. The Federated Press
is very careful about facts but they are presented with a
decidedly pro-labor interpretation just as we believe the
capitalist press interprets news so that it becomes pro-capitalist.</p>
</div>

<h3>Remote Control</h3>

<p>Incidentally, a comparison of the Federated Press budget
with that of the capitalist agencies casts some light on the difference
between real and formal equality. Federated Press
spent $18,000 in 1936. The three employer-minded agencies
spent $31,048,000 in a similar 12-month period (1942)!</p>

<p>Linked to sensationalism, the commodity form of news
destroyed the old profession of journalism and replaced it
with pure business. The individual honest reporter or correspondent,
however pure his intent, is sunk from the start.
The <em>form</em> of news he is taught to seek and permitted to send
is hostile to the nature of truth. Not only the reporter, but
the newspaper owner himself is alienated from the process
of gathering reliable information and printing it. He is a
merchant bound up with the problems of purchase and sale
of goods, circulation, advertising and the like.</p>

<p>The <i>Report on Freedom of the Press</i> takes for granted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
merchandising realities. It speaks constantly of “marketable
words and images” rather than “news.” No wonder! The
contents of newspapers are standard goods manufactured in
distant news agencies, syndicates, canned-editorial factories.
Development of 4-color facsimile processes by 800-word-per-minute
wireless transmission, plus air-express of films, mats
and plates, accentuates a trend. Simultaneous publication on
five continents of a whole magazine, forty-eight hours after
the material is written in a central editorial office anywhere,
is now possible. But newspapers are already, in effect, edited
at the central headquarters of banking and industry. And thus
the boasted “free press” of America has become a simon-pure
example of Big Business, absolute, brutal monopoly.</p>

<h3>The Fascist “Fringe”</h3>

<p>The increasingly monopolistic character of the press has
made its control by Big Business an automatic process. But
it has had still another result: to put the press under the
influence of the most reactionary, least responsible wing of
Big Business. The direct agency of this influence is the more
openly pro-fascist section of the press. Unfortunately, progressives
cling to the illusion that this section of the press
is a sort of fanatical “fringe,” ill-regarded in the trade. That
is an illusion, a dangerous one. This so-called “fringe” section
comprises the chains owned by Hearst, Roy Howard and
Patterson-McCormick. Their combined direct circulation,
according to the Editor and Publisher Yearbook for 1944, was
9,649,108 daily and 13,578,687 Sunday, roughly a quarter of all
newspaper circulation. Moreover, the readers of newspapers
subscribing to the Hearst International News Service, which
carries the Hearst political line in full, should be added to
the direct circulation figures. A tabulation from the 1944
Yearbook shows I.N.S. was sold to 290 daily and 104 Sunday
papers in 220 cities and towns of 38 states. Total circulation
of I.N.S.-subscribing papers was 15,827,856. This figure, plus
the circulation of the papers in the three chains (after eliminating
duplications) gives 22,043,146 as the actual audience
of the three chainsters—half the national circulation!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>It is only the beginning. They also own all the important
feature syndicates and the two private news agencies, U.P.
and I.N.S. They control most of the columnists, more powerful
than the editorial pages. (Westbrook Pegler alone is said to
have 10,000,000 circulation.) Their competition and methods
exert a direct influence on rival papers and on Associated
Press, aside from their many memberships in A.P. (one for
each member paper). Their papers dominate circulation in
such key areas as New York, Chicago and Washington.</p>

<p>But there is still more. Decisive is this fact: they form, in
effect, a single political bloc. The power of the bloc begins
with its material foundation, as described above. Here the
new factor enters. The three chains are not just important
units in the highly profitable merchandising enterprise called
the newspaper industry. They are active and conscious political
forces. They have a program. They utilize their papers and
personnel for active organization of reactionary movements
and drives. They are not only available to such characters
as Representative Rankin and Senator Bilbo; they not only
feature the hate-speeches of such men: they write the speeches
and inspire their delivery. They instigate fascist activities.
Goering and Rosenberg did not have to seek Hearst out and
bribe him to print their Nazi ravings under their own by-lines:
<em>he sought them out!</em></p>

<p>It was war-long support by this bloc that prepared MacArthur’s
dictatorship of the Pacific today. It was their persistent
slandering of the Soviet Union throughout the war that
prepared the general hysteria of the press immediately the
war had ended. The mere fact of their operation as a bloc,
would assure their dominance over the press as a whole
unless there were an equally powerful counterbloc. But there
is as yet no effective counterbloc—this is one of the primary
tasks still to be tackled by labor and the people. For the
reactionary program of the pro-fascist bloc is but the unrestrained
expression of Big Business’ inner drives. It is but
the crude utterance of the prejudices hidden by more cultured
newspaper owners. It is the open sore that betrays the hidden
disease of our unfree-press: complete subservience to the
private interests of the biggest monopolies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I want the people of every land to be as fully informed
as we are, through a press of varied inclinations toward the
philosophies of the day.”—Kent Cooper.</p>
</div>

<p>What the American press is at home—an arm of the State—it
is abroad. The press, and the forces behind it, have formulated
an aggressive program for pushing American commodity
news into every corner of the earth. The program is put in the
form of a demand for adoption of “freedom of the press as we
know it” by all nations. The President, the State Department,
the Congress have formally adopted the news industry’s
program as a basic unit in American foreign policy.</p>

<p>The first major action of the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights was to set up a subcommittee on the “free
press,” to consider a resolution along American lines. There
was strong pressure to adopt the American view in its entirety.
The U.S. has also insisted that many foreign countries accept
American correspondents and adopt American news concepts
if they want diplomatic recognition.</p>

<p>Speaking for the American newspaper industry, Kent Cooper
has further proposed that no country should obtain aid of any
kind from the U.S. without acceptance of these views. Official
backing of Cooper has gone so far that Congress even delayed
a United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency appropriation
in an attempt to impose a “free press” condition for
U.N.R.R.A. aid.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the wedding of press and State has
carried the “free press” demand far beyond the limits of news
policy, no matter how you define the latter. A privileged status
is being demanded for the news industry, as witness Cooper’s
suggestion that correspondents be given <em>diplomatic immunity</em>!
But the matter is far from stopping there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>It is not generally known that the American news industry
has now attained virtual domination of the world news market—which
means every country except the Soviet Union and its
immediate neighbors. The story of the battle for world opinion
control will be told in later pages. Here it is enough to point
out that official pressure for world news “freedom” has a
double purpose. First, it is aimed to break down Soviet resistance,
especially in respect to reported plans of Tass, official
Soviet news agency, to serve Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria,
Austria, Hungary and Rumania. Second, it is designed
to further expand and consolidate the powerful world position
of the American news monopoly against future challenges
by its now feeble rivals.</p>

<p>In such a program, news is a naked arm of Empire. It cannot
be separated from the territorial, military-strategic, economic
and political aspects of American foreign policy. The increasingly
imperialistic tone of that policy, the spread-eagle
drive for absolute world power, is more and more reflected
in the demands of the news industry. Thus, Arthur Hays
Sulzberger, publisher of the banker-minded <i>New York Times</i>,
frankly states the connection between the two. In a speech
containing the crude threat of atomic bombs and the flavor
of political blackmail, he declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I do not believe that free peoples can afford to trust
dictatorships. We should not share our military secrets, or
make any financial agreements, calculated to build the
Soviet Union until we in this country have more knowledge
of her and her ways.... I think we should put definite
limits upon our cooperation ... until we have the same
freedom of access to the news of Russia as they have to
the news over here....</p>

<p>Access to the news is, therefore, my condition for full
cooperation and I should hold to that position uncompromisingly.
The elimination of censorship would be but a
small part of compliance with this condition. <em>Access to the
news means freedom to travel at will—to talk with whomsoever
one wishes—it means finding communications systems
available—it means the right of a business man to see how
his product is used or whether a market for it exists....
I say this as a newspaper man, it is true, but in this all-important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
freedom we in the newspaper profession act as
your agents.</em></p>
</div>

<p>What Sulzberger and the news industry are demanding, is
acceptance by the Soviet Union of the system of special privileges
for private enterprise that prevails here. At the very
least, they would require the Russians to agree that information
is a commodity to be peddled exclusively by morally
irresponsible private organizations. If the Soviet Union could
be forced to bow to American private enterprise in this instance,
a capitalist wedge would have been inserted in the
Socialist system.</p>

<h3>Lawful Spies</h3>

<p>Any newspaperman who has worked abroad, or among
foreign correspondents here, knows that there is the closest
connection between the work of a correspondent and the interests
of the State. Walter Lippmann, in criticizing Congress
for the attempted U.N.R.R.A. holdup, pointed out that virtually
all of a correspondent’s news comes from officials and
business men of his own country, plus some friendly foreign
diplomatic sources. There is no clear line separating the correspondent
from the Embassy officials of his country. There
is even less sharp a distinction between the <em>information</em> exchanged
by the correspondent with Embassy officials and the
“<em>intelligence</em>” supplied by agents and outright spies.</p>

<p>The recent Pearl Harbor inquiry dented the old shallow
idea of “intelligence” which centered on beautiful Mata Haris
and stolen plans, though the recent Canadian spy-scare exploited
this popular misconception. The United States has
just created a new national intelligence agency on a more
realistic basis. Gathering of every kind of public and secret
information, plus the over-all evaluation of the total information,
is the job of the new agency. Evaluation of information
at every stage is essential. Poor evaluation led General
Marshall to believe—and to tell a press conference—that the
Nazis would go through the Red Army like a hot knife
through butter; later that Japan was militarily a joke.</p>

<p>For the function of gathering information and evaluating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
it as it is gathered, the correspondent is ideally equipped.
Since his work is conditioned to the objectives of the dominant
interests in his own country, and even of his own government
to varying degrees, he cannot be regarded as an innocent man
from Mars, dispassionately reporting history as it unfolds. As
a matter of fact, news values are determined, for the correspondent,
with relation to state policy. Events are not “news”
unless they have some bearing on the progress or lack of
progress of specific American policies. The current American
coverage of the Balkans is typical. Correspondence from that
area is almost exclusively concerned with the Anglo-American
effort to get “reliable” governments installed. The correspondent
makes no pretense of drawing a positive picture of
life in those lands.</p>

<p>But over and beyond what the correspondent reports, or
does not report, is his value as a contact man. It is not for
nothing that Sulzberger stresses complete freedom of motion
and contact for the business man and correspondent alike.
In the Socialist sphere, and in rival imperialist territory, the
American newspaperman is part of a network of capitalist
contacts within the country to which he is assigned. He is a
war correspondent and intelligence agent in peacetime!</p>

<p>This question of contacts is as decisive for the newspaper
business as it is for intelligence work. And it provides an
interesting link with the secret history of the world news
cartel. For just such contacts were the foundation of the
global news monopoly. And the cartel was, from the start,
unmistakably at the service of commercial and state interests!</p>

<h3>News Since Feudal Days</h3>

<p>Near the middle of the past century, governments, bankers,
rich merchants, kept private couriers who travelled to all
important European capitals. By carrier pigeon—and in
America also by pony express—they sent specific information
on prices and market conditions, plus general political information
required for their long-range business planning. The
couriers built up extremely valuable contacts that would have
made them very valuable to newspapers. But newspapers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
couldn’t afford their costly services and the couriers couldn’t
afford to lose their rich clients by publishing their information.
Newspapers had the right to print news but no way
to get it.</p>

<p>The telegraph broke that situation wide open. It made the
relative isolation of the newspapers impossible; it spelled the
doom of the private news systems.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">A</a> It ended feudalism in the
information field. But not everyone saw that immediately.
Paul Julius Reuter, Prussian government courier with many
business clients and topnotch European contacts, understood
it at once. He determined to switch to newspapers, offering
a telegraphic news service to several papers at once. Germany
was no place for a progressive idea in 1851, and Britain was
the nation with the most extensive world interests, so Reuter
set up shop in London. His idea was a smashing success.
Reuters soon was the all-powerful government-backed British
Empire news monopoly.</p>

<p>Charles Havas, a Hungarian, established a similar monopoly
for the French Empire and France’s sphere of interest, and
Dr. Bernhard Wolff did as much for Germany. In the United
States, Associated Press grew out of the same conditions, except
that the agency, like the nation itself, was almost wholly
absorbed in internal development, almost entirely disinterested
in the rest of the world. Toward the close of the century,
however, there were signs that the tremendous productive
forces developed under American capitalism would ultimately
seek <em>an</em> empire if not world empire. The country began to
show more interest in <em>world</em> news. Associated Press, to improve
its monopoly position and bar the possibility of successful
competition at home, sought exclusive rights to a supply
of world news. It made a deal with the European agencies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>That deal and the world news relationships of which it was
a part, were well hidden from the world prior to World War
II, but the war completed a change in the former secret
relationships. Marking this change, A.P. chief Kent Cooper
published the story of the news cartel in 1942. His book was
called <i>Barriers Down</i>. Cooper published it only to mobilize
support for his “crusade.”</p>

<p>Cooper’s “crusade” is nothing more than a drive for world
news monopoly. <i>Barriers Down</i> is designed to justify American
imperialist news domination by coating it with high
moral purpose. The <i>London Economist</i>, organ of battered
British imperialism, notes in its issue of December 2, 1944:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Cooper, like most big business executives, experiences
a peculiar moral glow in finding that his idea of freedom
coincides with his commercial advantage. In his ode
to Liberty there is no suggestion than when all barriers are
down the huge financial resources of the American agencies
might enable them to dominate the world. His desire to
prevent another Goebbels from poisoning the wells will be
universally applauded, but democracy does not necessarily
mean making the whole world safe for A.P. In this, as in
other post-war issues—such as civil aviation—commercial
practices are habitually confused with such big words as
“liberty and the Rights of Man.”</p>
</div>

<p>Cooper’s book nevertheless lends the strongest authority to
what would otherwise be an almost incredible story of news
imperialism. We shall lean on it heavily.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_28"><i>Chapter V</i><br>

<span class="subhead">SECRET HISTORY OF A CARTEL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The story begins in the 1840’s with the formation of the
great modern news agencies in obedience to the click of the
telegraph key. At that time, Great Britain dominated the
world. France, a powerful state, was nevertheless a link in
the British system. Germany had not yet fully emerged as a
modern industrial power. Russia, ruling a sprawling empire,
was herself, in a sense, something of a political and economic
“colony” of the more advanced European states. The Far
East was one huge, thinly-disguised sphere for European exploitation,
too, with Britain hogging the lion’s share. The
United States, in addition to exercising little influence in
world affairs, lacked the immediate facilities for world news
competition: Great Britain controlled almost all cable and
other communications.</p>

<p>Under these conditions, there arose what Kent Cooper justly
terms “the greatest and most powerful international monopoly
of the 19th Century,” the world news cartel. Considering that
A.P. voluntarily participated in it, Cooper’s highly moral tone
is strange. It is true, nevertheless, that the agencies “brought
under their control the power to decide what the people of
each nation would be allowed to know of the people of other
nations and in what shade of meaning the news was to be
presented.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Summarizing the situation, the A.P. boss continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For long years Reuters, acceptably to Havas and Wolff,
had divided the globe among the three according to
Reuters’ idea of proper spheres of influence for each....
Reuters received English-speaking North America, in which
since 1893 the A.P. had bought exclusive territorial rights.</p>

<p>For long years Reuters, acceptably to Havas and Wolff,
was granted a free hand in Canada. Later this free hand
was extended to include Mexico, Central America and the
West Indies where Reuters and Havas held the sovereign
rights. The two, however, admitted no control whatever
to Wolff, the German Agency, in the Western Hemisphere.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
Reuters had Great Britain, including all the colonies and
dominions, Egypt, Turkey, Japan, China and what might
be called the suzerain states, or those in which England
had exerted a sphere of influence.</p>

<p>Havas [since succeeded by France-Presse] controlled the
French Empire, Switzerland and all the Latin countries,
including Italy, Spain, Portugal and those in South America.
[Also the Balkans.]</p>

<p>To Wolff [later D.N.B. or the Deutsches Nachtrichten
Buro] fell the Scandinavian states, with Russia and all the
Slav nations. Austria also came under the jurisdiction of
the German agency.</p>
</div>

<h3>A Conflict Is Born</h3>

<p>Reuters used its control frankly in the interest of the British
Empire and of British business interests. Havas and Reuters
combined to carry stories that would tend to ridicule American
manufactures and America, but they refrained from such
handling of Britain and France respectively. All over the
world, news from America was top-heavy with Indians on the
warpath, lynchings in the South, bizarre crimes in the North.
Havas headed off American business competition with France
in South America—a Havas exclusive territory—by stories belittling
U.S. automobiles and other products. (Very reminiscent,
one may note, of the American news industry’s deliberate
belittling of Soviet industrial products and skills and
planning, propaganda that misled even our highest authorities
prior to Stalingrad.)</p>

<p>Anglo-French ridicule was gall and wormwood to American
Big Business as it moved more and more into competition
for world markets, world influence and world power. It was
more immediately vexing to Associated Press but A.P. never
went outside the gentlemanly bounds of the conspiracy. It used
the cartel as a club to beat back United Press and other
would-be rivals at home.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, an ultimate conflict between A.P. and Reuters
was inevitable. The United States was building up industrial
might and developing resources to overtake and pass Great
Britain in the race for world power. This was somewhat
obscured, for the general observer, by the rather more aggressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
challenge of Germany. Germany, too, had built up
a modern industrial productive apparatus far greater than
that of Britain. It found the world already divided. Markets,
raw materials, the slave labor of colonies and their investment
opportunities, had been “parcelled out” among Britain,
France and their satellites: Holland, Belgium, Portugal. British
and French guns were levelled against any suggestion of
sharing the plunder with the newcomers. So German imperialism
levelled its guns, too, and World War I was on.</p>

<h3>Peak of Reuter’s Power</h3>

<p>With Britain and France and Germany engaged in worldwide
warfare while the United States (until 1917) stood on
the sidelines, Reuters, Havas and Wolff were severely handicapped.
Even under peacetime conditions they could not
compete with the American agencies on a commodity-news
basis. Their official or semi-official character restricted their
freedom of action and of judgment. The moment something
really important happened in Europe, they would hesitate,
under official pressure. For example, when the Nazis murdered
Austrian Premier Dollfuss, Havas sent nothing for hours
while the Quai d’Orsay debated how French-controlled areas
should be informed of this event, how it should be interpreted.
The “officialese” in which such events were reported sometimes
achieved peaks of silliness. A dispatch to New York
from Havas bureau in Beirut, Syria, in 1934, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>French governor visited hinterland first time since elections.
On every hand he was greeted with enthusiasm by
populace which thanked him for all France had done to
relieve food crisis. Extremists threw a few bombs but vigorous
police measures reassured people.</p>
</div>

<p>Reuters was no less one-sided in its devotion to British interests,
and the national agencies of the smaller States were
doubly handicapped. On the one hand they were mere creatures
of Reuters-Havas; on the other, they were bound out
to the service of their own State. The mere listing of the
national agencies dancing to the Reuters-Havas tune establishes
the political significance of the cartel. They were: Amtliche<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Nachrichtenstelle, Austria; Agence Telegraphique Belge,
Belgium; Agence Telegraphique Bulgars, Bulgaria; Bureau
de Presse, Czechoslovakia; Ritzaus Bureau, Denmark; Agence
Telegraphique Esthonienne, Esthonia; Finska Notisbyran, Finland;
Athena, Greece; Nederlandsch Telegraaf Agentschap,
Holland; Agence Telegraphique Lettone, Latvia; Agence
Telegraphique Hongroise, Hungary; Stefani, Italy; Kokusai,
Japan; Avola, Yugoslavia; Agence Telegraphique Lithuanienne,
Lithuania; Norsk Telegram-Bureau, Norway; Agence
Telegraphique Polonaise, Poland; Rador, Rumania; Rosta,
Russia; Fabra, Spain; Tidningarnas Telegrambyra, Sweden;
Agence Telegraphique Suisse, Switzerland; Anatolie, Turkey.</p>

<p>These agencies were financially controlled by Reuters-Havas-Wolff,
but they could not have been independent even
if there were no financial control. In the first place, the cables
were British and aside from direct restrictions imposed by
Great Britain on users of the cable, manipulation of rates
could determine the profit or bankruptcy of a stubborn
agency. On top of that, Havas and the smaller agencies were
not only news but also advertising agencies, monopolistic ones.
Newspapers, in Europe and Asia alike, got Reuters-Havas
news service free—in effect, and they had to use it if they
wanted the advertising by which they lived.</p>

<p>This dominating position gave the European agencies a
haughty and clumsy attitude toward transmission of news.
They could delay or garble the most important events. It also
gave them no incentive to technical advance. Havas was still
using the stylus instead of the typewriter in the 1920’s. So
long as and wherever Britain and France remained the ruling
powers, the agencies could get away with it. But wherever
and whenever some other power could challenge Anglo-French
rule, a challenge to the news agencies would follow. South
America was the “where” and World War I was the “when.”</p>

<h3>Conquest of South America</h3>

<p>Havas was boss of South America according to the cartel
contract. As soon as World War I started, therefore, Havas
decided exactly what South Americans could be permitted to
learn about the war. It goes without saying that only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Allied side was to be reported. But such was the inflexibility
of the official agencies, that Havas was unwilling to transmit
even the German war communique when asked to do so by
leading South American papers. It could not unbend that
much to head off the obvious danger of losing South America
to some American rival agency.</p>

<p>This was A.P.’s great opportunity, but the agency was fearful
of losing the advantages of cartel membership if it made
a bid for South America. Manager Melville Stone considered
that the cartel might oust A.P. and admit the newer United
Press to membership. Accordingly, he left unanswered a request
by <i>La Nacion</i> of Buenos Aires, one of the world’s leading
newspapers, for A.P. service.</p>

<p>New pressures, however, were at work. Within A.P., Kent
Cooper, then only Traffic Manager, learned for the first time
of the cartel and of A.P.’s humiliatingly inferior position in it.
He began what he likes to call his “great crusade,” by which
he means a thirty-year fight to substitute American for British
news domination of the world. From outside the agency came
insistent demands by the government for aid in advancing
national policy. The State Department made a crude subsidy
offer with the aim of bribing the South American press. Stone
later wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The State Department asked me to employ the editors
of almost every leading paper in South America on handsome
salaries as correspondents of A.P. ... whether they
sent us news or not ... and the government would recoup
us for anything we paid.... They want something more
than a mere news report.... They want some sort of
illuminating service from the United States to indicate that
this country is not money-grabbing or territory-grabbing.</p>
</div>

<p>Incidentally, a similar proposal was made for the Far East.
A.P. rejected the proposals. Moreover, “government propaganda”
was one important reason. Moreover, “government propaganda”
organizations were regarded as inadequate and unstable
instruments for conquering news control. A.P. felt the
government interest, for one thing, was not likely to survive
the war. Even more important was the fact that the American
news industry has always heavily exploited its alleged “independence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
of direct government ties” as proof of its non-partisan
character.</p>

<p>But far from refusing all forms of subsidy, the news industry
fought for and obtained aid in the form of “practical rates
for news transmission; rates attractive enough to encourage
the export of news from the U.S.” The government had for
some years encouraged the laying of new American-owned
cables. Now, at the “behest of the State Department,” the
American-owned cable company gave lower rates to American
clients than to Havas, for news to South America. American
news went to South America after all, therefore, on behalf of
the State Department.</p>

<p>A.P.’s conservatism might well have cost it the chance to
seize South America. But United Press, unhampered by cartel
obligations, started operations there. That shook A.P.’s complacency.
Cooper insisted that the cartel give A.P. full freedom
to operate in South America. Stone said: “Go ahead and
advocate as much liberty as possible, but don’t do anything
to bring a break between the A.P. and our European news
agency allies.” There was, however, no serious resistance.
Reuters told Havas to agree or else. Havas yielded.</p>

<h3>Redividing the World</h3>

<p>World War I was fought for the redivision of the world
among the existing imperialist powers. Germany lost her
colonies and the German Republic was reduced to the role of
a vassal state serving the American-Anglo-French victors. This
situation was duly reflected within the news cartel where Wolff
lost territory and was permitted to serve only Germany itself.</p>

<p>A.P. scrambled clumsily for a share in the spoils. Cooper
hurried to Versailles to ask the U.S. treaty delegation to fight
for A.P. parity with Reuters and Havas. This was to be
expressed in the form of a “free press” clause in the peace
treaty. President Wilson’s right-hand man, Colonel House,
very sympathetic to the American news monopoly’s desires,
agreed to sound out the possibilities. He reported, in a few
days, that the question had been “taken care of privately” and
he could do nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>How it was “taken care of,” Cooper reports with great indignation.
His account, coming as it does from a member of
the gang—a disgruntled member but still one of the boys—is
of great authority. It is necessary only to warn that, writing
in 1942, he showed no great anti-Nazi fervor and discreetly
dodged the ticklish problem of the Soviet Union. He does not
mention the great <i lang="fr">cordon sanitaire</i>—the strangling “safety
belt”—set up around the new Socialist State after World War
I, but is full of pity for Germany.</p>

<p>Cooper says he learned that a cartel meeting had been held
in which the heads of Havas and Reuters had conferred alone
while Dr. Heinrich Mantler, head of the Wolff Agency, was
left to smoulder in an anteroom. When Reuters-Havas had
decided the redivision of the globe, Mantler was called in and
told the bad news.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Reuters and Havas, matching the political terms of the
Versailles Treaty, built their own news agency <i lang="fr">cordon
sanitaire</i> around Germany. All the political states bordering
on Germany were allowed to have only news agencies
owned or controlled by either Reuters or Havas or both.
In other words, the position of the news agencies in those
border countries was harmonious with the determination
of England and France to keep Germany hemmed in by
little nations mostly pro-Ally, such as Finland, Sweden, Norway,
Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria,
Czechoslovakia and Poland.</p>
</div>

<p>A borderline area was the Saar Valley, the Palatinate and
Rhenish Prussia. The French Government wanted that for
Havas. Reuters was neither wholly unwilling nor enthusiastic,
because Britain wanted a moderately strong Germany to
act as a check on France. Finally, and subject to the Saar
Plebiscite 15 years later, “they made a compromise by which
Wolff Agency might serve there, but a copy of Wolff service
should go to the Havas Agency, and if it was not satisfactory
Wolff could be removed from there.”</p>

<p>The victors were not averse to tearing slices of territory
from one another, either, so within the winning combination
some changes were made. Havas retained the bulk of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
Balkans, but Greece and Turkey passed “into Reuters’ [Britain’s]
sphere of influence.”</p>

<h3>Battle for Asia</h3>

<p>A.P. remained a stepchild during all this time. It obtained
a free hand in South America, as already related. But in general,
just as Great Britain was slow to recognize and acknowledge
the unmistakably superior position of the rival American
imperialism, so Reuters took a haughty tone toward A.P. requests
for adjustments in their relations. Outside the cartel,
accordingly, A.P. built up positions and alliances for an ultimate
showdown. Inside A.P., Kent Cooper gathered allies for
his more aggressive program against the still dominant go-slow
policy of Melville Stone.</p>

<p>While Britain was deeply involved in World War I, the U.S.
greatly extended the American communications network.
Monopoly in communications was deliberately fostered to “advance
the national interests.” This process, begun during
World War I and continued through World War II, is described
in the previously-cited <i>Report on Freedom of the
Press</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">B</a> As this study is financed by a <i>Time</i> magazine grant and
has semi-governmental, semi-official news industry standing, it
is not critical of imperialist expansion. All the more weight
must be attached to its admission that State and industry are
one in communications and news-export.</p>

<p>These new government-fostered monopolies now played an
important part in the forward march of American news.
Though A.P. had refused to do a propaganda-job under government
control, it was not at all reluctant to let the government
pay for A.P.’s expansion. This is what happened:</p>

<p>The Far East was the scene of the first open clash with
Reuters. Reuters’ absolute domination of world news produced
some peculiar effects on American-Oriental information
exchange. West Coast publishers, led by Hearst, were frantic
about the situation. Cooper’s first ally within A.P. was V.&#160;J.
McClatchy, California publisher who reflected the violent anti-British,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
anti-Japanese policies of Hearst. McClatchy, in turn,
won the support of Adolph Ochs, publisher of the most powerful
newspaper in America—the <i>New York Times</i>. A.P. was
now consciously but cautiously working toward an ultimate
showdown with Reuters.</p>

<p>McClatchy went to Washington in 1919 to seek Congressional
aid. When he told Congress about the news aspects of
American imperialism’s secret struggle in the Orient, the legislators
were indignant. Reuters, it was demonstrated, mangled
all American news printed in Japan, China and the Far East
as a whole. Even news between the U.S. and the Philippine
Islands had to go by way of London for British profit and
British editorial slant.</p>

<p>Japan was the key news country in the Far East. Until
1914, the country had no news agency of its own. Reuters
not only controlled the import and export of news but had the
direct internal monopoly as well. Japan had to pay Reuters
what amounted to an annual subsidy, after 1914, to get out of
Japan and let the Japanese form a news agency, Kokusai,
which got all its non-Japanese news from Reuters. The
American news report for Far East distribution was now circulated
by Kokusai; Reuters-Havas Far East news to the U.&#160;S.
was transmitted via Kokusai. It amounted to an Anglo-Japanese
alliance against the U.&#160;S. The garbling of news
that resulted was beyond imagination; British bias strained
through Japanese culture and policy!</p>

<p>Congress ordered the U.&#160;S. Navy to put its radio circuits
at the disposal of the agencies. The order specified rates
that were, in effect, a subsidy to permit the agencies to compete
with Reuters. Again, it was U.P. that moved first. A
new Japanese agency, Nippon Dempo, was set up and it used
the U.P. “report.” Later, Nippon Shimbun Rengo was formed
to replace Kokusai. Rengo constantly sought A.P. service,
but the cartel would not consent. On the whole, British control
of Far Eastern news remained unimpaired.</p>

<p>This was the situation in 1925 when Kent Cooper became
General Manager of A.P. In 1927, Cooper went to Europe
to negotiate a new “treaty” with Reuters, Havas and Wolff.
He wanted A.P.’s gains since 1893—the rights acquired in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
South America, for instance—put in writing. He especially
wanted the cartel to admit A.P. to Japan on the plea that
other American agencies were there and were serving the home
market with non-cartel news.</p>

<p>As Cooper put it, he wanted a new contract primarily in
the interest of plain-speaking. He said: “It seemed to me
that if the A.P. wanted to be in on a division of the world
as between the other three agencies the contract should specify
what territories were allotted to each.” The new contract
did exactly that. Without the shadow of double-talk, it stated:
“Reuters shall have the exclusive exploitation of the following
territories....” The British and Dutch Empires and most
of the Far East were included in these territories. Havas had
“exclusive exploitation” of Italy, Spain, Portugal and the
Balkans as well as the French Empire. Associated Press had
“exclusive exploitation” of North America and shared South
America with Havas.</p>

<p>Now that is plain enough even for me, a disillusioned newspaperman
weary of piffle about “freedom of the press.” That
is straight business talk as among “legitimate” monopolists.
It is, in short, a cartel agreement for the division of the world
market in news. But there is a sequel to the story. When
Cooper returned from Europe with his new contract, A.P.
Board members were horrified by the word “exploitation.”
Cooper explains their squeamishness by saying that “the word
has taken on a stigma in the United States which it does not
have in Europe.” An evasive word was substituted and the
contract was approved. “Exploitation” disappeared but the
cartel reality remained.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">C</a></p>

<p>With respect to Japan, the head of Reuters, Sir Roderick
Jones, made a verbal agreement to permit A.P. dealings with
Rengo. He could not put it in writing, he said, because it would
be a loss of face to Reuters (that is, to the British Empire).
Neither side had any intention of yielding to the other, in
practice. Power would tell, they knew, and force would decide
the issue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<h3>The Showdown</h3>

<p>They differed in their estimates of power distribution. The
relationship of forces had vastly changed since 1893. The
United States had been slow to enter world competition because
it was busy with internal development. But the delay
actually improved its chances, for when it finally laid down
a claim for world position, it did so on the basis of an incomparable
home market. In the commodity-news industry
this was strikingly clear. At a meeting of the A.P. Board of
Directors, <i>Chicago Tribune</i> publisher McCormick once offered
some estimates in this connection. The estimates were
so impressive that Cooper got him to repeat his statement for
the benefit of any directors who had missed the import. Said
McCormick:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are pretty much the most important country in the
world and much the richest country in the world, and in comparing
America with other foreign countries the press stands
probably higher in America than any other institution. I
think it is a pretty good guess that American newspapers
print and supply two-thirds of all the world’s news, and I
think that the revenue of all the American newspapers is
probably three-fourths of all the revenue of the newspapers
of the world.</p>
</div>

<p>It was on the strength of this tremendously favorable competitive
position that A.P. laid down the gauntlet to Reuters
in 1932. It demanded “free competition.” Meaning that
Japan, for instance, must be free to switch from Reuters to
A.P. service. All American monopolies tend to demand “free
competition” because they are now in a position to strangle
their isolated competitors. Nourished by a huge home market
built up with plenty of government aid, they no longer need
direct subsidy and want to establish a no-subsidy rule for
younger and weaker national news industries. The newspaper
industry is in an even stronger position than chemicals,
steel and other monopolies. In no other country has news-publishing
grown into a business of comparable size and
power. In no other country does the newspaper business
stand so near the top in the list of Big Businesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>A.P. understood this very well. Reuters misunderstood it
badly. For years it held out stoutly against A.P.’s right—verbally
admitted but never put in writing—to operate in Japan.
Jones was confident that A.P. would never risk a break with
Reuters; he counted on the threat that Reuters would take
U.P. into the cartel if A.P. walked out. Cooper deliberately
led Jones into a trap, pretending eagerness to maintain the
alliance but needling him at all points.</p>

<p>“While I wondered how long it would be before this bubble
of Reuters world domination would burst, I was willing for
Sir Roderick to blow his own bubble so big that it would burst
through his own exertion but I would not puncture it myself,”
Cooper gloats.</p>

<p>It burst in 1934. Carrying his pretense of humility and loyalty
to the uttermost limits, Cooper travelled from Japan to
London to explain to Sir Roderick that A.P.’s activities in
Japan were within the meaning of the contract. Pretending
to mollify Jones, he encouraged him to think that his own
actions were due to weakness either of A.P. or of his position
within A.P. Accordingly, Jones refused to sanction the A.P.-Rengo
deal. He announced that the cartel agreement must be
renewed on the old terms or Reuters would allow it to lapse.</p>

<p>Reuters had fallen into a trap. Not only A.P., but the
American news monopoly as a whole was determined to
humble the British. United Press joined A.P. in an agreement
establishing between themselves the principle of “non-exclusive
access to foreign news at its source.” This meant that U.P.
would not agree to replace A.P. in the European cartel. So
A.P. blandly notified Reuters that it “agreed” to let the
“alliance” lapse.</p>

<p>This announcement exploded with bomb-force in London.
Sir Roderick’s house of cards collapsed. Reuters was through
as the news dictator of the world and A.P. was king. Within a
few hours Reuters, recognizing what it had long failed to see,
offered to capitulate. Jones hurried to New York, begging for
an audience. He was forced to humiliate himself enough to
satisfy Cooper who had been waiting years for that triumph.
Then the “alliance” was renewed—on A.P.’s terms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<h3>World Conquest</h3>

<p>American news domination of the world was now assured.
The “non-exclusive” principle did not in the least destroy the
cartel; it merely made the cartel an instrument of American
policy. The old system of recognizing political controls remained
to some extent, in that Reuters, for instance, retained
the dominions and protectorates as partially privileged territory.
But a new system became the dominant one. The new
system opened territories once dominated by Britain, France
and Germany, to American news penetration, just as the basic
industrial-military potential of the United States was beating
the way for American political-economic penetration into those
sacred preserves. The “non-exclusive” principle governed
the new contract. The term sounds very lofty and moral. It
seems to mean that A.P. and Reuters would compete everywhere
on equal terms and let the better man win. Not only
that, but A.P.’s American rivals would have the same chance.</p>

<p>Alas, it meant nothing of the sort. The principle merely
established a new kind of monopoly in which political intervention
of the State on behalf of the monopoly no longer was
so blatant. Competition was still sharply restricted—not by
cartel agreement but by economic pressure. A.P. informed
Reuters for instance, that the British agency was absolutely free
to deal with U.P. The new contract guaranteed that and so
did A.P.’s agreement with U.P. But, said A.P., if Reuters
chose to exercise that freedom, A.P. would choose to deal with
Reuters’ British rival, Exchange Telegraph, and so destroy
Reuters! A.P. also informed Reuters it would have to deal
with Canadian Press through A.P.: thus, Canada passed from
the British to the American Empire!</p>

<p>That wasn’t really the end. World War II put the period
on the new contract. Havas crumbled all-at-once-and-nothing-first
like the wonderful one-hoss shay. Reuters’ internal crisis
matured and in 1941 the agency was liquidated as a private
profit-seeking body. It was reorganized as the British equivalent
of A.P. Within the Empire it is struggling for survival
against terrific American pressures, just as the Empire itself is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
creaking under American expansionist strains and the impact
of the rising liberation forces released by the anti-Axis war.
Sideswiped as a British government propaganda agency in a
semi-official State Department document recently, Reuters
indignantly denied the charge. In doing so, it acknowledged
the British surrender to the American commercial-sensational
news pattern which it resisted for so many years. Said Reuters
chief Christopher Chancellor: “We are not purveyors of British
news; news cannot be British or American—it is an international
commodity.”</p>

<p>The German D.N.B. has, of course, been liquidated. So has
Japan’s Domei. An American-sponsored German Agency,
D.A.N.A., has been set up in U.S.-occupied Germany with
favorable competitive advantages as against the British and
French agencies. U.&#160;S. Treasury funds have been used openly
in the battle for news control of Austria and other countries.
In Japan, under exclusive American occupation, American
news dictatorship is assured. With Britain restricted to Southeast
Asia, the whole Far East is rapidly becoming an American
private preserve. And not even the limits of the thinly-concealed
modern American empire provide boundaries for the
American news empire.</p>

<p>Only the Soviet Union and the new Eastern European
democracies, together with the anti-imperialist forces within
the dominated territories, stand in the way of complete global
sway by the new empire-aspirant and its news monopoly.
Against them, the “free press” monopolists are mobilizing the
blackmail batteries of atomic diplomacy. “It is unthinkable,”
declares Kent Cooper, “that the peace will not be dictated by
America and Britain and that there should not be included in
its terms the principles affecting the press as I have outlined
them.”</p>

<span class="subhead">RESPONSIBILITY—A CHALLENGE
TO THE PRESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>If World War I was a complex struggle for redivision of the
world between two imperialist groups, World War II was still
more complicated. An effective alliance of all forces opposed
to German-Japanese enslavement of the world was achieved.
Yet behind this alignment a good many battles were fought
for imperialist advantage.</p>

<p>The capitalist powers had joined with the Socialist Soviet
Union in a Grand Alliance, but the military activities of Britain
and the United States indicated that their whole heart
was not in the arrangement. The Soviet Union was permitted
for three whole years to carry the burden of the fiercest assault
known to history; under British pressure, the Anglo-American
military power was distributed along the relatively
inactive Empire lifeline. Thus, in effect, the allies fought Germany
with one hand and with the other built up positions
from which to crowd and “contain” the Soviet State.</p>

<p>Within the Anglo-American camp there was likewise double
dealing. Each party maneuvered with a view to postwar advantage
for No. 1 at the expense of his “gallant ally.” Early
in the war, Washington could boast that there was no need of a
Second Front since there were already a Third, Fourth, and
even a Tenth Front. This merely revealed that United States
forces were scattered all over the globe with little relation to
the needs of the alliance but with obvious effects on future adjustment
of Anglo-American differences. As part of the “war
effort” for instance, a contract was made to build and operate
an American military airfield in Arabia, across the gulf from
Persia, for three years <em>after</em> the war. This was but the expression
of a series of deals with Arabia, notably for oil, by which
the U.&#160;S. became dominant there while Britain was forced
back into second place. The phenomenon was worldwide.</p>

<p>As a result, American imperialism feels superbly assured of
its present strength. That assurance is demonstrated by our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
current atom-bomb diplomacy. All loan and other negotiations
stress the determination of our profit-swollen trusts to
impose their rule over the world. In the process, the British
are often forced to divide former private preserves, such as
southern Iran, and virtually to abandon competitive rights
in huge areas once under their chief control, such as China.
The American methods tend to be oblique: military and technical
missions are established in the country in question, “upon
request.” No request, no loan. This method replaces the crude
“Opium War” pattern in which Britain built and maintained
the world’s greatest empire of the past. But the same bloody
suppression of “natives” is behind both methods. In recent
months the British have slaughtered Greeks and Indonesians;
unwilling Marines have made Lidices in North China.</p>

<p>A dispatch to the <i>New York Times</i> from Athens helps illustrate
the new method. After noting that the United States
is far from withdrawing from Greece, the dispatch says: “The
State Department’s comments ... sounded much like what the
British had been telling the Greeks for some time.... It is
believed that the only substantial difference between British
and American views relates to the extent to which Allied officials
should be injected into the Greek civil administration.
The British originally intended to ask for a practical veto
over acts of the Central Bank and Ministries dealing with economic
affairs. It is now suggested that the British will suggest
something much closer to the concept enunciated by the State
Department yesterday: technical assistance to Greece ‘upon the
request of the Greek Government.’”</p>

<p>In effect, as in Kent Cooper’s 1927 contract, the word “exploitation”
has been removed, but the imperialism is still there.
And among the industries making great headway in all “assisted”
countries is the American news industry. It is favored
by the change in the ownership of communications. Britannia
no longer rules the waves—either of the air or the sea.
Telephone, telegraph, cable dominance is no longer hers.
Aviation, radio, multiple-address newscasting and facsimile
broadcasting, are off to a good start under the control of American
interests. And whatever advantages British imperialism
still has, she is forced by the State Department to relinquish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
in return for a loan. Cable communications with British
Empire points, for instance, are still in British hands. Yet
not long ago conferences were held in Bermuda and Rio de
Janeiro at which American government representatives compelled
the British to cut press cable rates from New York to
Empire points. This admitted American opinion-forming
“news” to at least equal status with similar British propaganda
in the Empire itself.</p>

<p>Now the government is also going into the business of distributing
“news about America, by Americans.” The news
agencies contend that a government information service is
“propaganda,” whereas they “distribute the news as such,
wholly unbiased and without intent to influence.” This is an
empty boast. Riegel, in <i>Mobilizing for Chaos</i>, says: “The press
associations differ in the amount of direct government control
affecting them, but all are obviously governed by the newspapers
they serve, and the destinies of all of them are inseparably
united with the destinies of the nations with which
they are identified. An impartial international news-gathering
organization does not exist.” The <i>Report on Freedom of the
Press</i> calls news-export an “adjunct of diplomacy and national
policy. This inevitable relationship is no less real in the U.S.
for having been avoided by the government, resisted by industry,
and needlessly confused by imaginary threats of encroachment
upon the First Amendment.”</p>

<p>State Department, A.P., U.P., I.N.S., alike provide “opinion-forming”
material designed to further the current dangerous
drive for American imperialist rule of the world. They are
at one, moreover, in pressing foreign news services to abandon
their present spheres of influence in favor of the American
news monopoly. The Soviet news system, which checks the
functioning of outside opinion-formers in the Soviet Union and
helps limit their activities in Eastern Europe, is their favorite
target. But they have made little headway there.</p>

<p>When Randal Heymanson of the North American Newspaper
Alliance visited Czechoslovakia last year, government
spokesman Dr. Theodore Kuska talked with him. Dr. Kuska
said the Czech film industry would be nationalized and <em>newspapers
would be published only by political parties, trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
unions and similar responsible groups</em>. “Only in this way,”
said Dr. Kuska, “can the press be regarded as truly free.”</p>

<p>It is not recorded whether the N.A.N.A. representative
swooned on the spot. But for the benefit of Brooks Atkinson,
it should be pointed out that some of the responsible groups
Dr. Kuska speaks of cannot even be heard in the American
press. The conditions earlier described prevent their publishing
papers or obtaining circulation of their views. Thus,
control of the press and control of opinion is rigidly frozen
into monopoly shapes here; the Czech proposal seems to promise
a much broader freedom of the press.</p>

<h3>Responsibility of the Press</h3>

<p>Indeed, if Mr. Atkinson will look about him in the Soviet
Union, he will see an extension of the idea suggested by Dr.
Kuska. As described by Alexander Kendrick at an American-Soviet
Cultural Conference in New York recently, the Soviet
press is unique. Before the Revolution, there were 859 newspapers
in the Czar’s realm, with a total circulation of 2,700,000
and a policy dictated by the Russo-Asiatic Bank. Today there
are 9,000 papers in 80 languages with a circulation of 40,000,000
and several readers to every copy of each paper.</p>

<p>Compared to our papers, there are obvious differences: no
sensation, no spice, no scandal, no desperate competitive drive
for entertainment. The newspapers are all informative, they
tend to be typographically excellent, their news is presented
in careful, balanced form so that the constant reader is prepared
to grasp new developments as they take place. The
cultural leaders of the country, scholars, critics, writers and
musicians, contribute to the papers.</p>

<p>The principal difference, however, is in their publishers. No
paper is published for profit. No multimillionaire can control
public opinion. No people’s organization is without a newspaper:
trade unions, hundreds of them; national groups; local,
district and national government councils; sport groups; youth
groups; women’s organizations. They are crusaders, too; not
reactionary anti-vivisection crusaders like the Hearstlings here,
but stinging critics of public and governmental bodies for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
sloppy execution of their tasks. And there is a contact between
the readers and the papers that would be inconceivable here.
Newspaper staffs hold regular meetings with readers to discuss
problems raised by the readers and most papers have an annual
readers’ conference at which editors make public accounting
of their stewardship. The Soviet Constitution guarantees
printing presses and stocks of paper to the organizations
of the people, such as trade unions, cultural and scientific
organizations, etc. It has not remained a paper promise: the
press is entirely in popular hands. It operates in a responsible
way to further Soviet objectives by stimulating more active
support, by exposing failures.</p>

<p>There is, however, definitely no freedom of the press for
rent-collecting landlords, bankers, industrial monopolists. The
Soviet press is frankly not a formally democratic press but a
press of the working people. That no longer bars any important
body of Soviet citizens, since exploiting classes no longer
exist there. The rule operates primarily to assure an ever-expanding
popular participation in the nation’s political and
economic life, while it hampers the work of hostile foreign intelligence
services. This would hardly seem the fit subject of
a diplomatic protest by the British Foreign Office or the U.&#160;S.
State Department.</p>

<p>A press of that kind would solve most of the problems of
“freedom of the press” in our country. It can be attained
somewhat short of Socialism, as is occurring in some parts of
Eastern Europe. But such a goal must be recognized as a distant
one. Its attainment will require the utmost effort of the
whole American people. A first step is to spread understanding
of the class character and function of the press as a whole.</p>

<h3>What Can We Do?</h3>

<p>Is there anything we can do about the present super-monopoly
control of our press which gags all but a handful
of the 140,000,000 Americans? The individual writer can
hardly formulate meaningful proposals along this line. Labor
itself, particularly the larger progressive unions, the C.I.O. as a
whole, and strong combinations in industrial areas where trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
union membership is concentrated, must certainly give more
thought to the publication of newspapers. To be successful,
they will need labor’s formal participation but they must not
be limited to trade union scope. On the contrary, they should
champion labor’s political and other interests, as well as the
interests of the people as a whole. Labor must also seek a more
direct voice in the few relatively pro-labor dailies now in circulation,
because direct participation will reduce the waverings
to which liberal papers tend. <em>Labor must also combat the
commodity-news pattern and help create an audience for balanced,
trustworthy information. A labor paper should aim at
that end.</em></p>

<p>Beyond that, labor and liberals should consider legislation
to ease the present monopoly. Postal and communications subsidies—free
mailing, in fact—plus other government aid, should
be given to newspapers and mail-circulation newsletters of
responsible popular bodies. At the same time, government
subsidies should be taken away from the monopoly press;
private enterprise should be compelled to stand on its own
feet in the publishing business.</p>

<p>Finally, the truth about the American press—that it is the
uncontrolled and unlimited voice of monopoly capital—should
not operate to discourage constant pressure on the owners to
deal fairly and adopt more liberal policies. This is a democracy,
whatever its monopoly limitations; the publishers cannot
completely ignore voices that are numerous enough and insistent
enough. But the pressure should be concentrated where it
has most chance to do good: on the powerful pro-fascist press
bloc responsible for the worst excesses of our monopoly press.
The recent picket lines and boycott of the <i>Daily News</i> in protest
against columnist John O’Donnell’s anti-Semitic provocations,
demonstrate that results can be obtained. As a matter
of fact, the “Fascist fringe” is very vulnerable. A good, strong,
nationwide boycott, centering on the more blatantly fascist
preachings of the bloc, might very well act as a deterrent and
check on both policy and ownership. The curbing of the reactionary
bloc would improve the whole tone of the press.
This is the nearest thing to an attainable free press objective
in the United States, at least for today.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>It goes without saying that any realistic effort to improve
our press, must operate within the framework of a larger
political program. Only a program that understands the necessity
for curbing the huge monopolies—even within the limits
of the capitalist system—can seriously approach the problem
of press freedom. None but a program of independent labor-progressive
political action can even aim at this goal. Only a
program that takes Socialism as its ultimate objective, will consistently
understand and face the problems along the way.
This places the heaviest responsibility upon Marxists and class-conscious
workers, manual and intellectual, newspapermen
not least among them.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
